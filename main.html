<h1>Heading for the document Time and  SpaceComplexity </h1>
	<p> Most efficient time complexity because input size does not affect the algorithm's performance</p>
	<p>Space complexity is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space.</p>
	<p> Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine <b>space complexity</b>. However,
		people frequently confuse<b>Space complexity </b>with auxiliary space.</p>
