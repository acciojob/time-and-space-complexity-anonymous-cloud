<h1>Heading for the document Time and  Space , Complexity </h1>
	<p> Most efficient nput size does not affect Time complexity because input size does not affect the algorithm's performance</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space.</p>
	<p> Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine <b>Space Complexity</b>. However,
		people frequently confuse with auxiliary space.</p>
