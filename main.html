<h1>Heading for the document Time and  Space , Complexity </h1>
	<p> Most efficient nput size does not affect Time complexity because input size does not affect the algorithm's performance</p>
	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space.</p>
